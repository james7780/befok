WAV2LSF 1.1 USAGE

To get help on wav2lsf parameters, just run wav2lsf without any parameters.

You will get this:
Usage : wav2lsf [-c] [-h] [-v percentage] -o out in
-c              Ouput as C file
-h              Show histogram of sample
-v percentage   Adjust output volume
-o output_file  Specify the output file name

There is another hidden option "-p" which outputs as a "packed" sample (does not work with "-c" option).

Examples:

wav2lsf -o mywav.lsf mywav.wav

wav2lsf -c -o mywav.h mywav.wav
